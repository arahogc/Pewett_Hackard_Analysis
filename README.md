# Pewett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
Pewett Hackard is company that has been an undefined business for a long term and employs thousands of employees. They realized that they have a lot of employees that are approaching retiring age and will start retiring soon. In preparation for this, the company wanted to know how many employees will be retiring soon, how many titles they will need to replace as they start to retire as well, and in addition start a mentoring program where soon-to-be-retiring employees can mentor other employees to replace them. 

Analysis was conducted using SQL code. First, tables were created based on CSVs that were provided and then created an entity relationshp database (ERD) to track which primary and foreign keys shared amongst the different tables (pictured below). Once the ERD was established, then data was able to extracted and put into new datas for analysis. Upcoming retirement employees were employees whose birthday was between Jan 1st, 1952 and Dec 31st, 1955. The mentoring eligibility list was generated by looking at employees whose birthdays were between Jan 1st, 1965 and Dec 31st, 1965. Spoiler: A lot of people will be retiring soon, leaving a lot of vacant spots.

## Results

* The first table of retiring employees, labeled as retirement_titles, was generated from joining information from the employees csv and the titles csv. From the the retirement_titles, data was taken and put into the unique_titles table to count the number of titles that will be retiring soon. 

* There are several thousands of employees getting ready to retire. The department that will face the largest lost of employees would be the engineering. They will have 29,414 Senior Engineers, 14,222 Engineers, and 1,761 Assitant Engineers will be retiring soon.

* After discovering the concerning number of upcoming employees, data from the dept_emp, employee, and titles csvs was taken to create a lits of eligible employees that could be mentors, which is titled as mentorship_eligibility. 

* However, taking it a step further, an additional table was created to count the number of mentor titlles (similar to the retiring_titles). As one can seee in the image below, the number of mentors significantly smaller than that of the number of retiring employees. This should be taken into account as the company figures out how to replace the retiring employees and what they can do lessen the loss of talent internally.

## Summary 
In summary there are thousands of roles that will be need to replaced, a total of 60,984 employees will be retiriing. There are approximately 1,549 eligible emplyees for a mentorship program to help train people to replace those who will be retiring. This means that there are not enough eligible mentors to help the company as the employees begin to retire. 

In addition, it is concerning that not only is there a large number of senior staff retiring but those with titles that include "assistant" or related junior level indicators. The company should not only focus on training and replacing the talent loss due to retirment but also look at promoting employees internally as well and redefining promotion eligibility. This will not create incentive for employees to continue to do well at their position but will also help lessen the blow of losing so many senior level employees.
